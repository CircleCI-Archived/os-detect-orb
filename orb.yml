  This orb allows for simple detection of which operating system and/or 
  distribution CircleCI configuration is running in. This information is 
  useful in order to know which binaries to run, where certain files may be 
  located in the filesystem, or whether or not using `sudo` is needed.
  
  This orb is especially helpful as a utility for other orbs.
  
  Bash is a requirement. See repository for full documentation.
